# What is this library?

This library is intended to be the fastest implementation of LINQ extension to Unity.Collections.NativeArray<T>.
This provides allocation-free Enumerable structs and methods.

# How to Install

Add the reference to your 'manifest.json'.

# How to Use

Include namespace 'UniNativeLinq'.

# Internal Implementation

Internal Logic is separated into an DLL because I need to write logic in C#8.
